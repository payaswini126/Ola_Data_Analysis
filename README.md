üöñ Ola Ride Booking Analytics Dashboard 
üìå Project Overview

An end-to-end analytics solution analyzing 1,03,024 simulated Ola bookings in Bengaluru (July 2024). Using SQL for backend querying and Power BI for visualization, this project uncovers insights on ride volume, cancellations, customer loyalty, revenue flows, and satisfaction trends, enabling data-driven decisions for ride-hailing operations.

üéØ Objectives & Business Problem

Ride-hailing platforms face challenges like high cancellation rates, fluctuating demand, and driver-customer experience gaps.
This project aims to:

Track ride booking performance (success vs cancellations).

Analyze customer and driver behavior patterns.

Identify revenue leakage points and growth opportunities.

Provide business-ready dashboards to support strategy teams.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

SQL (MySQL): Data querying, views, aggregations.

Power BI Desktop: Interactive dashboards & data storytelling.

Power Query + DAX: Data cleaning, transformations, and KPI creation.

Data Modeling: Relationships across booking, customer, and metrics tables.

üìä Key Dashboard Features

Booking Status Breakdown: Success (62.09%), Cancelled (28.08%) split by driver/customer.

Revenue Analysis: ‚Çπ35M total booking value, broken down by Cash, UPI, Cards.

Customer Loyalty: Top 5 customers generated ‚Çπ30K+ revenue.

Cancellation Trends: Driver-related (17.89%) vs Customer-related (10.19%).

Ratings Monitoring: Both driver & customer ratings ~4.0, indicating stable satisfaction.

Ride Volume Over Time: Day-wise booking patterns for July 2024.
